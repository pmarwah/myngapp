#Directory Structure Improvements

#As per analyzing the existing code, rather than having all the files in one places, the code base can be modular based on common modules and reusable components

#Require JS is used to include JS files as needed.

#Naming convention has been used to clearly depict the componentname with it action like directive or service to have clear visibility from a dev standpoint also it will help in writing test cases more efficiently.

#Common CSS and Images are at the top level itself so that we don't have to traverse through many folders and directories


#Code Improvements

#Clean up index file to include the common components like Header, main body content and charts

#main app file will drive the application route and will require the files as well
